# **NextJS13**
I made this repo because I always forget the file structure of NextJS and have to look it up everytime I start a new project. Here is the easy way for you with the correct filestructure for NextJS13 according to [this article](https://dev.to/vadorequest/a-2021-guide-about-structuring-your-next-js-project-in-a-flexible-and-efficient-way-472). This is a _common_ filestructure used by most people nothing to fancy or complicated especially when it's first time using NextJS.

Happy developing :)
